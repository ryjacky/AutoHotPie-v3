## Currently the project is paused because I'm discovering the possibilities doing this in flutter since I find myself not liking electron after all :P
Specifically, the database thing and the IPC thing is making the src code hard to organize in a way I want.




# Pielette

A cross-platform radial menu. Originally the version 3 of [AutoHotPie](https://github.com/dumbeau/AutoHotPie) but later separated into its own repository. Big thanks to @dumbeau for the AutoHotPie project.

## What's difference between Pielette and AutoHotPie?
I've written this section, so you could choose between Pielette and AutoHotPie. Neither is superior to the other, but their focus is different.

## Development status
Pielette does not have any working releases yet. The first public alpha is expected to be released before 2024.

- Plugin System is dropped in Pielette because no stable solution was found.
